## Currently, what I do at western digital is to develop security features.

### [TCG](https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/TCGandNVMe_Joint_White_Paper-TCG_Storage_Opal_and_NVMe_FINAL.pdf)  provides that data stored on HDDs or SSDs is self-encrypted under policy-based access control. The following link explains the TCG storage specification more easily. https://www.kingston.com/en/community/articledetail/articleid/51969

### Because Speed

Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic
(or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It's a design system that provides
very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So,
rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write
your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names. This makes for a very
powerful way to style, in the browser, or while building a static site like this
one â€“ since you can see every change with every save. **It's a joy to use.**
