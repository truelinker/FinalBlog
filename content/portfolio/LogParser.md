excerpt: "When a bug or problem occurs, you can get a trace for debugging on the device, and when the amount of this trace is large, it can be several hundred mega. It is difficult to analyze all of this, so I developed a python script that evicts only the necessary parts and changes the enum numeric value to an enum string.."

### [Log Parser](https://github.com/truelinker/TraceParser)  In order to solve numerous bugs and problems, you need to look at log information generated by many drives. However, sometimes the log amount exceeds several hundred megabytes. In order to save time and effort, I created a parser python script, which is helping me to solve more problems in a timely manner while reducing time and effort.

### Because Speed

A huge amount of log files contain too much information. But not all of this information is what I need. So it is necessary to evict only the necessary information first. What makes this possible is to profile each problem. For example, create profile A for problem A, create profile B for problem B, and put the same keywords as problem A into the profile.

### Because Readable

There are several numeric values ​​in the log that has become a filter. These numeric values ​​are any result, but they are also enum values ​​used in the code. If you change these enum values ​​to enum strings, the filtered file becomes easier to read.
