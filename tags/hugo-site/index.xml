      <description>Currently, what I do at western digital is to develop security features. TCG provides that data stored on HDDs or SSDs is self-encrypted under policy-based access control.

      <description>Web RTC Using the WebRTC open source, I&amp;rsquo;d modified to implment my own p2p video chat application between the android native app and chrom web app.
Github : https://github.com/truelinker/webrtc_p2pvideo
How it works They connect to a room created by a server such as node.js and exchange information such as each other&amp;rsquo;s network information (ip, port). When starting a video call, the call starts by exchanging each other&amp;rsquo;s media information based on the given network information.</description>

      <description>Voca Master This is an Android application that I developed in 2011. This is an application that helps you memorize new English words.
Github : https://github.com/truelinker/vocaMaster
Abstraction Mobile devices are useful in many respects such as education, entertainment, and so on, because people bring their mobile gadgets all the time. Therefore, apps running on the devices are exposed to users anytime and anywhere. For the summer personal project, I‟ve developed an education app for the Android platform; the app is for helping people to memorize vocabularies with spending remnant time such as during waiting a bus, waiting a meal, and so on.</description>
