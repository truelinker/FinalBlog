      <description>Log Parser In order to solve numerous bugs and problems, I need to look at log data generated by many drives. However, sometimes the log amount exceeds several hundred megabytes. In order to save time and effort, I created a parser python script, which is helping me to solve more problems in a timely manner while reducing time and effort. How it works [1] Enter the path of the file where the Enum values are defined.</description>

      <description>Currently, what I do at western digital is to develop security features. TCG provides that data stored on HDDs or SSDs is self-encrypted under policy-based access control. The following link explains the TCG storage specification more easily. https://www.kingston.com/en/community/articledetail/articleid/51969 Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML.</description>

      <description>Web RTC Using the WebRTC open source, I&amp;rsquo;d modified to implment my own p2p video chat application between the android native app and chrom web app.
Github : https://github.com/truelinker/webrtc_p2pvideo
How it works Two peers (Android application and web application) connect to a room created by a server, I used a Javascript web server using node.js and exchange information such as each other&amp;rsquo;s network information (ip, port). When starting a video call, the call starts by exchanging each other&amp;rsquo;s media information based on the given network information.</description>

      <description>Voca Master This is an Android application that I developed in 2011. This is an application that helps you memorize new English words.
Github : https://github.com/truelinker/vocaMaster
Abstraction Mobile devices are useful in many respects such as education, entertainment, and so on, because people bring their mobile gadgets all the time. Therefore, apps running on the devices are exposed to users anytime and anywhere. For the summer personal project, I‟ve developed an education app for the Android platform; the app is for helping people to memorize vocabularies with spending remnant time such as during waiting a bus, waiting a meal, and so on.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1
Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>
