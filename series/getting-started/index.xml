      <description>Log Parser In order to solve numerous bugs and problems, I need to look at log data generated by many drives. However, sometimes the log amount exceeds several hundred megabytes. In order to save time and effort, I created a parser python script, which is helping me to solve more problems in a timely manner while reducing time and effort. How it works [1] Enter the path of the file where the Enum values are defined.</description>

      <description>Now I&amp;rsquo;m working at Western Digital as a firmware developer on a team that provides a common security engine for SSDs and HDDs. I am in charge of developing Security APIs so that the security engine provided by the team can be used according to the HDD characteristics. TCG protocols (TCG enterprise, opal, pyrite, etc). Sanitize ATA Security 1. [TCG] (https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/TCGandNVMe_Joint_White_Paper-TCG_Storage_Opal_and_NVMe_FINAL.pdf) provides that data stored on HDDs or SSDs is self-encrypted under policy-based access control.</description>

      <description>I developed a serial communication protocol. As for the background, as the tester that uses only a single serial bus was newly introduced, I had to change the firmware to use it with the tester that uses the existing dual serial bus, and I was in charge of developing the fimrware. The purpose of this project is to change the firmware to work with testers with different serial communication methods on the same firmware.</description>

      <description>Web RTC Using the WebRTC open source, I&amp;rsquo;d modified to implment my own p2p video chat application between the android native app and chrom web app.
Github : https://github.com/truelinker/webrtc_p2pvideo
How it works Two peers (Android application and web application) connect to a room created by a server, I used a Javascript web server using node.js and exchange information such as each other&amp;rsquo;s network information (ip, port). When starting a video call, the call starts by exchanging each other&amp;rsquo;s media information based on the given network information.</description>

Abstraction Mobile devices are useful in many respects such as education, entertainment, and so on, because people bring their mobile gadgets all the time. Therefore, apps running on the devices are exposed to users anytime and anywhere. For the summer personal project, Iâ€Ÿve developed an education app for the Android platform; the app is for helping people to memorize vocabularies with spending remnant time such as during waiting a bus, waiting a meal, and so on.</description>
